We provide this Privacy Policy to inform you about our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information we receive from users of our mobile and tablet gaming applications (“Apps"). This privacy policy applies only to the information you provide to us through the apps.

### How do we collect and use information?

Our main purposes in collecting information are to provide and improve our applications and related services (collectively, the “Services”), administer your use of the Services (including your account if you decide to create an account to use the Services) and enable you to use our services.

### Collection and use of information

In order to improve the work when using our service, I may require you to provide us with certain personal information that allows you to identify yourself. The information I request will be stored on your device and is not collected by me in any way.

  The application does use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you.

### Account Information

In connection with your use of the Services, we do not collect any information that can be used to contact you directly or identify you, such as your full name, email address, mailing address or phone number (“Personally Identifiable Information” or “PII”). However, we may collect certain other information that you provide to us, such as your nickname, if you use our services as a guest. If you decide to create an account to use the Services through one of your third-party social media accounts (e.g. Facebook) (“SNS Accounts”), you may need to provide us with your username (or userId) so that your identity can be verified by the SNS account. When authentication is complete, we will be able to link your account to the SNS account and access certain information such as your name, SNS account profile picture and SNS account identification number. We do not receive or store passwords to any of your SNS accounts.

### Information related to the use of the Services

Our servers may record certain information about how a person uses our services (we call this information “Log Data”), including both account holders and non-account holders (or “User"). The log data may include information such as the User's Internet Protocol (IP) address, device type, operating system, links and advertisements on our Services that the User clicked on, the amount of time during which you interact with the Services, and other statistics. We use this information to administer the Services and analyze (and may involve third parties in the analysis) This information is used to improve and supplement the Services, expanding their capabilities and adapting them to the needs and preferences of our Users. We also use the IP address to generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how our services are used.

### Location Information

In some cases, we collect and store information about where you are, for example, by converting your IP address into approximate geolocation. We may use location information to improve and personalize our services for you.

### Information about the mobile device

When you access the Services via a mobile device, we will collect information related to the mobile device, such as the serial number or MAC address and the device's public UDID. We may use this information to improve and personalize our services for you.

### Advertising and third-party products and services

The Services are supported through advertising, and we collect certain data to help the Services display ads. We may collaborate with analytics companies to help us understand how the Services are used, such as frequency and duration of use. We work with advertisers and third-party advertising networks who need to know how you interact with the advertising provided in the Services, which helps us reduce the cost of Services. Advertisers and advertising networks use some of the information collected by the Services, including the unique identification number of your mobile device. To protect the anonymity of this information, we use encryption technology that helps ensure that these third parties cannot identify you personally. These third parties may also receive information about other services that you have downloaded to your mobile device, mobile websites that you visit, information about your inaccurate location (for example, your zip code) and other inaccurate location information to help analyze and display anonymous targeted advertising on the Services and in other places.. We may also share encrypted versions of the information you provide so that our partners can add other available information about you for analysis or use in advertising.

### What Information Do We Share With Third Parties?

We will not share any information we have collected from you, except as described below:

Account Holders
If you decide to connect your SNS account to the Services, other users of the Services will be able to see your SNS account name and profile picture, as well as information related to your use of the Services, such as the number of times you accessed or used the Services.

Guest Users
If you decide to use the Services without connecting to an SNS account, your nickname and information related to your use of the Services, for example, the number of times you accessed or used the Services, will be available for viewing by other users.

### Information we share with our service providers

We may involve third-party service providers to work with us on administration and provision of Services. These third-party service providers have access to your information only for the purpose of providing services on our behalf and are expressly obligated not to disclose or use your information for any other purposes.

### Information transferred to third parties

We may share aggregated information and non-identifying information with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other similar purposes.

### Information disclosed in connection with business transactions

The information we collect from our users, including PII, is considered a business asset. As a result, if we go out of business or declare bankruptcy, or if we are acquired as a result of a transaction such as a merger, acquisition or sale of assets, your information may be disclosed or transferred to a third-party buyer in connection with the transaction.

### Information disclosed for our protection and the protection of others

Our policy is to protect you from the violation of your privacy as a result of abuse of legal systems, whether by individuals, legal entities or the government, and to challenge claims that we consider invalid in accordance with applicable law. However, our policy is also to cooperate with government and law enforcement agencies, as well as with private individuals. Accordingly, we reserve the right to disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement agencies or individuals as we, in our sole discretion, deem necessary: (i) to satisfy any applicable law, regulation or judicial process or to respond to legitimate requests, including subpoenas, warrants or court orders; (ii) to protect our property, rights and safety, as well as the rights, property and safety of third parties or the public in general; and (iv) to prevent or terminate activities that we consider illegal or unethical.

### Information that we disclose with your consent or at your request

We will share your information with third-party sites or platforms, such as social networking sites, if you directly ask us to do so through the Services.

### Security of your information

We take reasonable measures to protect the information we collect from or about you (including your information) from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. However, please keep in mind that no method of transmitting information over the Internet or storing information is completely secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any information.

### Links to other sites

Our services may contain links to other websites and services. Any information that you provide on a third-party website or service is provided directly to the owner of the website or service and is subject to the privacy policy of that party. Our privacy policy does not apply to such websites or services, and we are not responsible for the content, privacy or security policies of these websites or services. To protect your information, we recommend that you carefully read the privacy policies of other websites and services that you access.

### Changing Your Information

You can access the information associated with your account and change it in the Settings section Services. If you want us to delete your information and your account, please contact us with your request. We will take steps to delete your information as soon as possible, but some information may remain in archived/backup copies for our records or in accordance with other legal requirements.

### International translation

Your information may be transmitted and stored on computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other government jurisdiction where privacy laws may not be as secure as in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and decide to provide us with information, we may transfer your information to the United States and Brazil and process it there.

### Our policy regarding children

If we find out that we have collected personal data of a child under the age of 13, we will take steps to remove such information from our files as soon as possible.

### Changes to the Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. We will notify you of any changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy here. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.
